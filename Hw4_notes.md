## HW 4 notes

On becoming a demographer.... modeling the U.S. population, calibrating and projecting. A two class period assignment. 

Model of the U.S. population with projections to 2030 

1. Form the demographic model of the US population by cohort beginning in 1950 and ending in 1990. Compare your 1990 model value for the total population with that of the census. show the census bureau graph of the population along with yours on the same page. 
2. Project by eye all of the Birth rates, death and migration rates to the year 2010, run your model and compare your total population with that of the census. Show your graph and the census graph on the same page. 
3. Fill in the actual 1990 and 2010 rate data and run your model and compare as in 1. 
4. Project all rates to the year 2030, run your model and compare as in 1 with US Census Bureau mid range projection for 2030. 
5. Reduce the migration rates to 0 for the entire 1950 -> 2030 period and compare Census Bureau's midrange estimate for 2030 to your total in 2030. When making a numerical comparison of pop. totals, give the percentage difference in each case, 1 thru 5.
